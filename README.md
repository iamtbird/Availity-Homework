# Availity-Homework
This is my homework/assessment test for the Availity hiring process.

Question 1:
  My proudest professional achievement was playing a major role in moving an entire school of medical students to online classes to keep their schooling going when the pandemic started. 
  I was on a very small team and was tasked with being responsible for over a thousand doctors and future doctors to make sure they could continue their practice. 
  
 Question 2:
   I recently read "How to Lead When You're Not In Charge" by Clay Scroggins. It is a book that I certainly recommend to anyone, as it teaches not only how to develop and further a career, but how to continously be growing and moving forward without yet obtaining the future role we all want. 
    
Question 3: 
  Availity helps to connect insurance payers to doctors and hospitals.
